# Library

California public schools with strong school library 
programs outperform those without such programs 
on the state’s STAR tests.  The library at Azusa 
High School provides a full-time librarian, access 
to curriculum-integrated information, 
reference assistance to students and teachers, 
and access to the library's facilities, technology, 
and resources.

It’s about equity. Strong school libraries help give 
our students the best chance to succeed. [California School Libraries Make a Difference](http://www.cde.ca.gov/ci/cr/lb/caschoollibraries.asp) summarizes a recent study showing the difference school libraries make in education.
