# Parents & Students

Parents: We want the best for our students.  In this tough economic time, we ask parents to [become involved](#parent-groups) in their student's education. Please pick up your students from evening school activities at completion of the event.  It will be appreciated by those who stay to make sure your students are picked up safely!

## Parent Groups

## Online grading system for parents

[AERIES Parent/Student portal](http://www.azusa.org/portal/) is now available! Students were given their log-in information during their 4th period class. Parent letters were sent home on Friday, October 4th. You can now stay up-to-date with important school information. You can see your studentâ€™s grades, classes, attendance and a lot of useful information on AERIES, our new student information system.

To get started, read the [Easy to follow directions](http://www.azusa.org/MIS/AeriesHelp/StudentAndParentPortalGuide.pdf) and then [visit the portal](http://www.azusa.org/portal/).
