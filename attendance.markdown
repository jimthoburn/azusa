# Attendance Office

*Students will only be released to adults listed on their emergency card with valid I.D. and parental/guardian permission.*

### Attendance Policy

Azusa High Schoolâ€™s attendance policy is vitally important to the success of each student in the classroom. Students are expected to attend all classes on time every day. Truancy and tardiness affect achievement in the classroom and are monitored daily.  If your student is excessively absent, *parents will receive a phone call and/or a letter sent in the mail.* *The student may also be reported to the district office.*  Progressive discipline consequences given for continuing tardies. 

**Tardies are *not* excused.**

The student will receive an excused absence when a parent has contacted the attendance office with a note or phone call and identified the absence as:

1. Illness
2. Dr Notes (medical/dental)
3. Personal/Family business
4. Family religious observances
5. Court appearance documentation
 
*All other absences are unexcused.*

### Clearing Absences

A parent note or phone call (626-815-3491) is the only way an absence can be cleared.  It is expected that absences will be cleared within 24 hours.  Absences not cleared within 5 days will be recorded as a truancy.  When leaving a voice mail to clear an absence, please leave your name, student's name and I.D. number, the date, and the reason for the absence.

### If you need to have your child released early from school

Please call the attendance office after 7:30 am, or one hour prior to pick-up time. This will give us sufficient time to locate your child and give him/her an off- campus pass to meet you at the requested time.

### Request for Classwork/Homework

Homework will be be available for pick-up between 2:30 and 4:00 P.M. in the Guidance Office on the second school day after the request is received in the office.
