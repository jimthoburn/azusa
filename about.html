    <h2>Mission</h2>
      <p>At Azusa High School, we are the home of the Aztecs. We have longstanding traditions that include our mascots (Warrior and Warriorette) who are selected by the students each year. At each of our assemblies our mascots beat our Aztec Drum. Other traditions include the singing of our Alma Mater at the conclusion of every rally, on the buses returning to school after athletic competitions, and at the conclusion of every home football game. Our motto is: Once an Aztec, Always an Aztec”</p>

          <h2>Message from our principal</h2>
          <p>I am honored and privileged to serve as the Principal of Azusa High School. Azusa High School has amazing programs and pathways such as AP and Honors, International Baccalaureate Diploma Program, AVID, Engineering, Business, Visual and Performing Arts, Fashion and Interior Design, and JROTC just to name a few. At Azusa High School, we have an abundance of opportunities for students to get involved in co-curricular and extra-curricular activities including our band and pageantry, Aztec Singers, athletic programs, Leader Academy, and theater productions. The well-rounded educational experiences we offer will prepare students to be successful, well-rounded citizens and provide them with experiences that will shape their future endeavors. I sincerely believe that all students can achieve at high levels and I want to ensure that they have the opportunity to do so at Azusa High School so that they are prepared for college and career.</p>
